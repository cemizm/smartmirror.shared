and services, used by the smart mirror project.\nInstallation\nTo install this library, run:\n$ npm install @cemizm/smartmirror-shared --saveDocumentation\nA generated documentation of this project can be found here:\nGitHub Pages\nUsage\nAfter the Installation of the library via npm, you can import it into your Angular/Ionic application by adding the SmartMirrorModule to the AppModule:\nimport {BrowserModule} from \"@angular/platform-browser\";\nimport {NgModule} from \"@angular/core\";\nimport {AppComponent} from \"./app.component\";\nimport {SmartMirrorModule} from \"@cemizm/smartmirror-shared\";\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SmartMirrorModule.forRoot({apiUrl: 'https://sm-webapi.azurewebsites.net/api'})\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Once the shared library is imported, you can use its components, directives, pipes and services in your Angular application:\nimport {MirrorService} from \"@cemizm/smartmirror-shared\";\n\n... \n\n  constructor(private mirrorService: MirrorService) {\n\n  }\n\n
